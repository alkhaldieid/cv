 \begin{quote}
 ``I am an aspiring researcher with interests at the intersection of probabilistic machine learning and control theory. I am particularly interested in uncertainty quantification and as a result, a great deal of my work focuses on Bayesian non-parametric methods, specifically Gaussian processes and variational inference.''

{{{cvevent(Mechanical Engineer Intern,Mott MacDonald,June 2015 -- August 2015, London\, UK)}}}

# I worked as a mechanical engineer within the building services division where I developed my
# teamwork skills and learned the importance of knowledge management.
# I was in charge of optimising the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning of a building a
# Hackney Wick underground station.
# I met with external architects to communicate our ideas and I personally overcame logistical issues
# and improved a systems efficiency, resulting in the designs approval.
# I consistently met deadlines whilst working under pressure and was offered future employment.
# This internship strengthened my desire to move away from engineering and pursue a research driven
# career involving mathematics and programming.

- Developed teamwork skills, learning the importance of knowledge management within a team.
- Overcame logistical issues and improved a system’s efficiency, resulting in the design’s approval.
- Consistently met deadlines whilst working under pressure.
- Conducted a feasibility study and estimated project costs that informed subsequent action.
- Located an error and proposed a solution. Communicating this to relevant managers resulted in its successful implementation.
- Mott MacDonald offered me future employment following my summer placement.
